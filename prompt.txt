PXFX MPV MEDIA CONTROL SYSTEM - SESSION CONTINUITY PROMPT
=========================================================
Date: January 2025
Project: Robust MPV-based media control system for PxFx application

TASK OVERVIEW:
=============
Develop and test a robust MPV-based media control system for the PxFx application, focusing on:
- Seamless video transitions with robust end detection
- Advanced audio playback (background music, sound effects, speech/narration)
- Low latency audio (<100ms for sound effects)
- Real-time volume control and audio ducking
- Prepare code for easy integration into main PxFx system
- Ensure test scripts are modular and well-documented for future combination and reuse

COMPLETED WORK:
==============

1. VIDEO TEST SCRIPT (/opt/paradox/apps/pxfx/test/manual/test-screens.js):
   - Single MPV instance for seamless image/video transitions
   - "Smart property observer" for reliable video end detection
   - Waits for actual playback start before monitoring 'eof-reached' 
   - Handles pausing on last frame correctly
   - Integration-ready with detailed comments and reusable function markers
   - Successfully tested and validated
   - Clean debug output, production-ready code

2. AUDIO TEST SCRIPT (/opt/paradox/apps/pxfx/test/manual/test-audio.js):
   - Multiple MPV instances for different audio purposes:
     * Background music (looping, volume control, ducking)
     * Sound effects (pre-loaded, ultra-low latency ~1ms achieved)
     * Speech/narration (with auto-ducking of background music)
   - Real-time volume control via IPC
   - Multiple simultaneous audio streams
   - Comprehensive latency testing and performance monitoring
   - Integration-ready with detailed architecture comments
   - All requirements met with excellent performance

3. INTEGRATION PREPARATION:
   - Both scripts marked with "INTEGRATION" comments for reusable functions
   - Architecture and strategy documentation in code comments
   - Clear separation of test logic vs. production-ready components
   - Socket management patterns established
   - Error handling and cleanup patterns implemented

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
================
- Video end detection: Robust solution using smart property observer
- Audio latency: Target <100ms achieved (~1ms actual)
- Multi-track audio: Background + effects + speech simultaneously
- Volume ducking: Real-time background music control during speech
- Socket management: Multiple MPV instances coordinated via IPC
- Performance: All PxFx requirements met or exceeded

CURRENT STATE:
=============
- test-screens.js: Complete, integration-ready
- test-audio.js: Complete, integration-ready  
- Test media available in /opt/paradox/apps/pxfx/test/fixtures/test-media/
- Both scripts fully documented with integration notes
- All core functionality validated through testing

PENDING WORK:
============
1. IMMEDIATE (mentioned by user):
   - Modify order and selection of test sounds in audio test script
   - User will provide specific instructions for sound order changes

2. NEXT STEPS:
   - Create combined audio+video test script to verify synchronized operation
   - Test event coordination between audio and video systems
   - Extract reusable components for main PxFx integration
   - Create modular library structure for production use
   - Implement central socket/instance manager
   - Plan integration into main PxFx application architecture

3. FUTURE DEVELOPMENT:
   - Error recovery and fallback mechanisms
   - Performance optimization for production loads
   - Configuration system for media paths and settings
   - Logging and monitoring integration
   - Additional test scenarios as requirements evolve

CODE LOCATIONS:
==============
- Video test: /opt/paradox/apps/pxfx/test/manual/test-screens.js
- Audio test: /opt/paradox/apps/pxfx/test/manual/test-audio.js
- Test media: /opt/paradox/apps/pxfx/test/fixtures/test-media/
- Main workspace: /opt/paradox/apps/pxfx/

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
=================

Video System:
- Single MPV instance with IPC socket
- Smart property observer pattern for end detection
- Seamless transitions between images/videos
- Production-ready error handling

Audio System:
- Multiple MPV instances (background, effects, speech)
- Socket paths: /tmp/mpv-background-ipc.sock, /tmp/mpv-effects-ipc.sock, /tmp/mpv-speech-ipc.sock
- Pre-loading for instant sound effect playback
- Real-time volume control and ducking
- Latency monitoring and validation

Key Reusable Functions (marked in code):
- createAudioArgs() - MPV configuration
- sendMpvCommand() - IPC communication
- waitForSocket() - Socket ready detection
- measureAudioLatency() - Performance monitoring
- Smart property observer pattern (video)

INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE:
========================
- Audio instances run independently from video instance
- All use same IPC communication pattern
- Volume control coordinated through central controller
- Socket management can be unified
- Event coordination between audio and video systems
- Modular design for easy extraction and integration

TESTING STATUS:
==============
✅ Video transitions and end detection - VALIDATED
✅ Background music playback and looping - VALIDATED  
✅ Low-latency sound effects (<100ms requirement) - ACHIEVED (~1ms)
✅ Speech with background music ducking - VALIDATED
✅ Multiple simultaneous audio streams - VALIDATED
✅ Real-time volume control - VALIDATED
✅ IPC communication reliability - VALIDATED
✅ Error handling and cleanup - IMPLEMENTED
✅ Integration-ready code structure - COMPLETE
✅ Comprehensive documentation - COMPLETE

ALL CORE REQUIREMENTS SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
===================
- Sound effect latency: ~1ms (target: <100ms) ✅
- Video transition: Seamless, no gaps ✅
- Multiple streams: Background + effects + speech simultaneously ✅
- Memory usage: Efficient (audio-only instances) ✅
- Socket communication: Reliable, fast response ✅

NEXT SESSION ACTIONS:
====================
1. Resume with audio test script modifications (user will specify sound order changes)
2. Create combined audio+video test for full system validation
3. Begin extraction of reusable components for main PxFx integration
4. Plan production architecture based on test learnings
