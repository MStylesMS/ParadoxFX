# Per-Zone Ducking Enhancement

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the enhanced per-zone ducking system for ParadoxFX, which provides unified, zone-scoped ducking for speech and video playback with overlapping management.

## Problem Statement

The original ducking system had several limitations:
- **Global scope**: Ducking affected ALL zones, not just the requesting zone
- **No overlapping handling**: Multiple duckers could interfere with each other  
- **Fixed ducking levels**: No per-command customization of ducking intensity
- **Simple restoration**: Timeout-based unduck without proper lifecycle management

## Solution

### Core Features

1. Zone-scoped ducking: Each zone maintains its own independent ducking state.
2. Overlapping management: Multiple active duckers are tracked and the most-negative (largest absolute) duck level wins.
3. Ducking parameter: Optional `ducking` field (negative integer, e.g. -26) accepted on `playSpeech` and `playVideo` commands.
4. Deterministic lifecycle: Zones apply a duck when media starts and remove that exact duck only when the media actually ends (no timeout-based unduck).

### Implementation Details

#### BaseZone Enhancements

```javascript
// Per-zone ducking state
this._activeDucks = new Map(); // key -> duck level (negative units)
this._baseBackgroundVolume = null;

// Core methods
_applyDucking(duckId, level)     // Add ducking with unique ID (negative units)
_removeDucking(duckId)           // Remove specific ducking
_updateBackgroundVolume()        // Recalculate and apply volume using absolute reduction
```

#### Command Extensions

**playSpeech with ducking:**
```json
{
  "command": "playSpeech",
  "audio": "general/Hello.mp3",
  "ducking": -26
}
}
```

**playVideo with ducking:**
```json
{
  "command": "playVideo", 
  "video": "intro.mp4",
  "ducking": -24
}
```

#### Default Ducking Levels and Precedence

- Speech default: -26 (applied when no other override provided)
- Video default: -24
- Images: 0 (no ducking)

Precedence for resolving ducking level for a media playback request (highest → lowest):
1. Explicit `ducking` parameter in the command payload
2. Per-zone INI setting (`speech_ducking` / `video_ducking`)
3. Global INI defaults (`speech_ducking` / `video_ducking`) loaded by the config loader
4. Code default (-26 for speech, -24 for video)

#### INI Configuration

Per-zone ducking defaults can be customized in the configuration file:

```ini
[screen_living_room]
device_type = screen
# ... other settings ...
speech_ducking = -26    # Override speech ducking default
video_ducking = -24     # Override video ducking default

[audio_kitchen]
device_type = audio  
# ... other settings ...
speech_ducking = -30    # Different defaults per zone
video_ducking = -20
```

#### Validation and Error Handling

Rules enforced:

- Only negative integer ducking levels are meaningful and applied. Positive values are treated as 'no duck' and ignored (the system will log a warning and publish a warning event).
- Extremely large negative values are clamped to a safe lower bound (implementation caps may vary; the code will warn if the value is out of range).
- Non-numeric values are ignored and fall back to the precedence chain above.

Warning example (MQTT-style event):

{"type":"warning","message":"Positive ducking values are not allowed (25), ignoring ducking"}

#### Overlapping Behavior

When multiple duckers are active in the same zone:

1. The system tracks each ducker with a unique ID and level.
2. The most-negative ducking level (largest absolute reduction) is applied globally within the zone.
3. When a ducker is removed, the system recalculates the active most-negative level and applies that (no premature restoration).
4. When all duckers are removed, the zone restores the original background volume.

#### Example Scenario

```
Initial volume: 80
1. Speech starts (-26 ducking) → Volume: 54 (80 + (-26))
2. Video starts (-50 ducking) → Volume: 30 (80 + (-50), using most negative)
3. Speech ends → Volume: 30 (still using video's -50)
4. Video ends → Volume: 80 (restored to original)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Speech with default ducking (-26)
mosquitto_pub -t "zone/commands" -m '{"command": "playSpeech", "audio": "hello.mp3"}'

# Speech with custom ducking (-50)  
mosquitto_pub -t "zone/commands" -m '{"command": "playSpeech", "audio": "hello.mp3", "ducking": -50}'

# Speech with no ducking
mosquitto_pub -t "zone/commands" -m '{"command": "playSpeech", "audio": "hello.mp3", "ducking": 0}'

# Video with light ducking (-15)
mosquitto_pub -t "zone/commands" -m '{"command": "playVideo", "video": "intro.mp4", "ducking": -15}'
```

### Zone Isolation

```bash
# Duck only in living room
mosquitto_pub -t "living-room/commands" -m '{"command": "playSpeech", "audio": "announce.mp3", "ducking": -40}'

# Kitchen remains unaffected  
mosquitto_pub -t "kitchen/commands" -m '{"command": "playSpeech", "audio": "timer.mp3", "ducking": -25}'
```

### Testing

Unit and integration tests should cover:

- Duck registry operations (add/remove, id tracking)
- Overlapping ducker resolution (most-negative wins)
- Volume calculation and restoration
- Validation and edge cases (positive values, non-numeric input)

Manual test example:

```bash
# Start background then play speech with explicit ducking
mosquitto_pub -t "paradox/houdini/picture/commands" -m '{"command":"playBackground","file":"default.mp3","loop":true}'
sleep 1
mosquitto_pub -t "paradox/houdini/picture/commands" -m '{"command":"playSpeech","file":"hint.mp3","ducking":-50}'
```

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
- `lib/zones/base-zone.js` - Added ducking registry and helper methods
- `lib/zones/audio-zone.js` - Updated playSpeech with new ducking system
- `lib/zones/screen-zone.js` - Updated playSpeech and playVideo with ducking

### Documentation  
- `docs/MQTT_API.md` - Added ducking parameter documentation

### Testing
- `test/unit/per-zone-ducking.test.js` - Comprehensive unit test suite
- `test/integration/per-zone-ducking-integration.test.js` - Zone interaction tests
- `test/manual/test-per-zone-ducking.sh` - Manual testing script

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible**
- Existing commands without `ducking` parameter use sensible defaults
- Old global ducking methods preserved for legacy compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing MQTT API

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal overhead**: Map operations are O(1) for add/remove
- **Efficient calculation**: Volume updates only when duckers change  
- **Memory efficient**: Only stores active duckers, auto-cleanup on removal

## Future Enhancements

1. **Event-based unduck**: Replace timeout with actual media end events
2. **Fade transitions**: Smooth volume transitions instead of instant changes
3. **Priority levels**: Different ducker priorities beyond simple max level
4. **Cross-zone coordination**: Optional ducking propagation between zones

## Validation

- ✅ 23 unit and integration tests passing
- ✅ Code validation successful
- ✅ MQTT API documentation updated
- ✅ Manual test script provided
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

The enhancement successfully addresses all requirements from issue #22 and provides a robust foundation for advanced audio management in ParadoxFX systems.
