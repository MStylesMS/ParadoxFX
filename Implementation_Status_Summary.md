- [ ] Dynamic device discovery and hot-plugging
- [ ] Audio effect chains and processing
- [ ] Zone synchronization for multi-room audio

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Achievements

1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Unified audio system working across Pi0, Pi4, Pi5, and desktop Linux
2. **Device Abstraction**: Simplified device aliases that auto-resolve to hardware-specific names
3. **Multi-Audio Type Management**: Background music, speech, and effects with intelligent interaction
4. **Low-Latency Effects**: Fire-and-forget sound effects with minimal delay
5. **Automatic Volume Ducking**: Background music automatically reduces during speech
6. **Multi-Output Support**: Single zones can output to multiple audio devices simultaneously

### ðŸ”§ Technical Specifications

#### Supported Platforms
- **Raspberry Pi 0/0W**: Analog output only
- **Raspberry Pi 4**: Analog + dual HDMI outputs
- **Raspberry Pi 5**: Dual HDMI outputs (no analog)
- **Desktop Linux**: Variable based on hardware and audio system

#### Audio Device Discovery Methods
1. **PulseAudio/PipeWire**: Primary method for modern systems
2. **ALSA**: Fallback for older systems
3. **MPV Enumeration**: Last resort device detection

#### Audio Types and Behavior
1. **Background Music**: Continuous, loops, ducks during speech
2. **Speech/Narration**: Queued, priority-based, triggers ducking
3. **Sound Effects**: Immediate, can overlap, low-latency
