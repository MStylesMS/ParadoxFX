# ParadoxFX Multi-Platform Media Control System

## Overview

ParadoxFX (formerly ImageSwitcher) is a comprehensive Node.js application designed to control multi-zone media playback, lighting, and automation devices via MQTT commands. Originally designed for Raspberry Pi single-screen installations, it has evolved to support multiple hardware platforms with advanced multi-zone audio/video capabilities for interactive installations, escape rooms, theaters, and immersive experiences.

## Terminology

- **Physical Device**: The actual hardware running the application (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4, Linux PC)
- **Soft Device/Zone**: Individual controllable endpoints within a physical device (e.g., HDMI-0 port, HDMI-1 port, headphone jack)
- **Multi-Zone**: Multiple independent soft devices operating simultaneously on one physical device
- **Enhanced Audio System**: Three-subsystem architecture (Background Music, Sound Effects, Speech/Narration)

## Supported Hardware Platforms

ParadoxFX supports multiple hardware platforms with optimized configurations for each:

- **Raspberry Pi 3 Model B/B+**: Single HDMI plus headphone jack
- **Raspberry Pi Zero W**: Mini HDMI only
- **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B**: Dual HDMI plus headphone jack
- **Raspberry Pi 5**: Dual HDMI (no analog audio)
- **Generic Linux Machines**: Scalable multi-display configurations

For detailed hardware specifications, performance characteristics, and use cases, see [Appendix A: Hardware Platform Details](#appendix-a-hardware-platform-details).

## Features

### 1. Enhanced Multi-Zone Audio System

ParadoxFX features a comprehensive three-subsystem audio architecture designed for professional installations:

#### **Background Music Subsystem**
- **Purpose**: Continuous ambient audio with seamless looping
- **Management**: Persistent MPV instance with IPC control
- **Features**: Real-time volume control, automatic ducking during speech
- **Latency**: Optimized for smooth transitions and volume changes
- **Use Cases**: Ambient soundscapes, atmospheric music, environmental audio

#### **Sound Effects Subsystem**  
- **Purpose**: Short-duration responsive effects
- **Management**: Fire-and-forget MPV instances for parallel playback
- **Features**: <50ms latency, overlapping effects, instant triggering
- **Performance**: Optimized with --audio-buffer=0.02 --cache=no
- **Use Cases**: Button clicks, alerts, feedback sounds, impact effects

#### **Speech/Narration Subsystem**
- **Purpose**: Voice instructions, hints, and narration
- **Management**: Queue-based system with automatic background music coordination
- **Features**: Automatic ducking, queue management, priority handling
- **Integration**: Coordinates with background music for seamless audio experience
- **Use Cases**: Guided instructions, hints, character voices, announcements

### 2. Multi-Platform Media Playback

- **Image Display:**
  - Full-screen image display using MPV exclusively
  - Hardware-accelerated rendering with platform-specific optimizations
  - Seamless integration with video playback through single MPV instance per zone
- **Video Playback:**
  - Hardware-accelerated video using MPV with platform-specific optimizations
  - Multi-zone support on Pi4/Pi5 with independent video streams per soft device
  - Single MPV instance per zone for seamless media transitions
- **Audio Routing:**
  - Independent audio device targeting per zone. The implementation currently uses PulseAudio-compatible tooling (pactl) and `pulse/<name>` device identifiers; full PipeWire-only handling is not guaranteed and is under review (see `docs/Issues.md`).
  - Simultaneous multi-zone audio with different content per soft device is supported via configured audio devices and runtime combined-sink handling.
  - Platform-specific device identifiers are used primarily in PulseAudio-compatible form; mapping to native PipeWire identifiers may require additional glue.

### 3. Platform Configuration Templates

Pre-configured .ini templates for each supported platform:

- **pfx-pi3.ini**: Single-zone Pi3 optimized configuration
- **pfx-pi0w.ini**: Low-power Pi Zero W configuration  
- **pfx-pi4.ini**: Dual-zone Pi4 with all audio options
- **pfx-pi5.ini**: Enhanced Pi5 dual-zone configuration
- **pfx-linux.ini**: Generic Linux multi-zone setup

#### **Seamless Media Transitions**

ParadoxFX provides professional-grade seamless transitions using per-zone MPV processes (images/video) with IPC control; audio playback (background music, speech, effects) is managed via separate MPV instances created by the AudioManager.

**Image-to-Video Transitions:**
  - Zone MPV instance loads image and can pause on first frame when the media is a video
  - IPC commands seamlessly switch to video playback without application restart
  - Hardware-accelerated transitions minimize visible interruption
  - Zone-specific control allows independent transitions per soft device

**Video-to-Image Transitions:**
  - Video playback can be configured to keep the last frame using MPV options (e.g., `--keep-open=yes`) but the implementation adds duration-based EOF handling and playback-time polling to robustly detect media end
  - IPC commands load next image while maintaining MPV session
  - Smart queue management determines whether to pause or continue to next media
  - Multi-zone support allows independent media flows per soft device

- **Audio Coordination:**
  - Background music subsystem continues seamlessly during visual transitions
  - Sound effects can trigger precisely with visual changes via IPC timing
  - Speech subsystem coordinates with media transitions for narrative flow

### 4. Advanced Media Queuing and Control

-- **Queueing:**
  - Video queuing is implemented as an application-level FIFO with explicit replacement rules for static visuals (setImage). When the configured queue length is exceeded the oldest video command is dropped.
  - Audio queuing differs from video: speech uses a dedicated queue with de-duplication and completion promises; sound effects are fire-and-forget MPV spawns. These differing semantics are intentional but should be revisited (see `docs/Issues.md`).
- **Video/Image Queue Logic:**
  - The screen queue handles `playVideo` and `setImage` commands to ensure smooth transitions and logical playback order.
  - **Queuing a New Command:** When a new `playVideo` or `setImage` command is received, it is handled as follows:
    - **Duplicate Check:** If the new command is identical to the last command already in the queue, it is ignored.
    - **Replacement Logic:** The system checks the last item currently in the queue:
      - If the last item is an `setImage` command (for any file type) OR a `playVideo` command for an *image* file, it is considered a "static visual" and is **replaced** by the new command.
      - If the last item is a `playVideo` command for a *video* file, it is considered an "active visual" and is **not replaced**. The new command is added to the end of the queue.
  - **Playback Behavior:**
  - `playVideo` (with video file): Plays the video. When configured, ducking is applied by the zone layer (ScreenZone) which coordinates with the AudioManager for background audio reduction.
    - `playVideo` (with image file): Displays the image. Does not duck audio.
    - `setImage` (with video file): Loads the video and pauses on the first frame. Does not duck audio.
    - `setImage` (with image file): Displays the image. Does not duck audio.
  - **Resuming Playback:**
    - A `resumeVideo` command will resume the currently paused video.
    - If a `playVideo` command is issued for the *same file* that is currently loaded and paused (from a previous `setImage` command), it will be treated as a `resumeVideo` command to avoid reloading the file.
- **Stop Commands:**
  - `stopVideo`, `stopAudio`, `stopAllAudioFx`, and `stopAll` commands immediately stop playback and clear queues as appropriate.
  - `sleepScreen` and `wakeScreen` commands control display power management

### 4.1. Intelligent Screen Power Management

ParadoxFX implements intelligent screen power management that balances energy efficiency with responsive user experience:

#### **Default State**
- **Power On**: All connected displays remain powered on by default when ParadoxFX starts
- **Default Image**: Optional configurable default image displayed on startup (default: `default.png`)
- **Stay Active**: Displays remain active indefinitely without automatic blanking or sleep

#### **Sleep Commands**
- **Manual Sleep**: `sleepScreen` command puts displays into low-power sleep mode
- **DPMS Control**: Uses X11 DPMS (Display Power Management Signaling) to communicate with displays
- **State Persistence**: System remembers sleep state and maintains it until explicitly woken

#### **Automatic Wake Behavior**
- **Media Triggers**: Any media command (`setImage`, `playVideo`) automatically wakes sleeping displays
- **Audio Triggers**: Audio commands that route to HDMI (not analog) also wake displays
- **Instant Response**: Wake occurs before media playback begins for seamless user experience
- **Smart Detection**: System distinguishes between HDMI audio (triggers wake) and analog audio (no wake)

#### **Wake Commands**
- **Manual Wake**: `wakeScreen` command explicitly wakes sleeping displays
- **Default Image Restore**: After wake, displays return to configured default image if no other media is playing
- **State Synchronization**: Wake command synchronizes all connected displays
- **Transition Behavior:**
  - Videos automatically pause on the last frame using MPV's `--keep-open=yes` option
  - If no additional media is queued, video remains paused on final frame
  - If media is queued, seamless transition occurs via IPC commands
  - Queue management determines whether to hold final frame or continue playback flow

### 5. Enhanced MQTT Integration

- **Multi-Zone Command Routing:**
  - Zone-specific topic structures for independent control
  - Broadcast commands for synchronized multi-zone operations
  - Device-specific command validation and routing

- **Advanced Audio Commands:**
  - `playBackgroundMusic`: Start background music with volume control
  - `playSoundEffect`: Trigger low-latency sound effects  
  - `playSpeech`: Queue speech with automatic background music ducking
  - `setBackgroundMusicVolume`: Real-time volume adjustment
  - `clearSpeechQueue`: Immediate speech queue management

-- **Enhanced Status Reporting:**
  - Real-time audio subsystem status (background music, effects, speech queue)
  - Multi-zone device health and basic performance monitoring (heartbeat)
  - Detailed audio latency and low-level platform performance metrics are not currently published by the code; consider opening an issue to specify required telemetry (see `docs/Issues.md`).
  - Platform-specific hardware status reporting is available at a heartbeat level; deeper metrics require additional instrumentation.

-- **Configuration Management:**
  - Device discovery and capability reporting
  - Remote logging and debugging capabilities

  NOTE: Runtime hot-reload of the full `pfx.ini` via MQTT is not implemented; configuration is parsed at startup. If runtime configuration updates are required, add a tracked item in `docs/Issues.md`.

### 6. Comprehensive Device Configuration

Platform-optimized configurations are provided as templates for each supported hardware platform. All device configurations are stored in a single `pfx.ini` file using section-based format:

- Single INI file contains all device types (screens, lights, relays, audio zones)
- Each device gets its own section with platform-specific optimizations
- All devices share a single MQTT broker connection with intelligent routing
- Enhanced audio system configuration with three-subsystem architecture

#### **Example: Raspberry Pi 4 Dual-Zone Configuration**

```ini
[mqtt]
broker = localhost
port = 1883
client_id = pfx-pi4-01

[global]
log_level = info
media_base_path = /opt/media
max_concurrent_videos = 2
enable_hardware_acceleration = true

# Zone 1 - HDMI-0 with enhanced audio
[screen:zone1-hdmi0]
type = screen
topic = paradox/zone1/screen
display = :0
xinerama_screen = 0
audio_device = pulse/alsa_output.platform-fef00700.hdmi.hdmi-stereo
background_music_volume = 70
effects_volume = 100
speech_volume = 90
mpv_video_options = --hwdec=auto --vo=gpu --profile=gpu-hq

# Zone 2 - HDMI-1 with independent audio
[screen:zone2-hdmi1] 
type = screen
topic = paradox/zone2/screen
display = :0
xinerama_screen = 1
audio_device = pulse/alsa_output.platform-fef05700.hdmi.hdmi-stereo
background_music_volume = 70
effects_volume = 100
speech_volume = 90

# Lighting integration
[light:zone1-main]
type = light
topic = paradox/zone1/lights/main
controller = hue
bridge_ip = 192.168.1.100

[controller:hue]
type = hue
bridge_ip = 192.168.1.100
bridge_username = your-hue-username
```

### 7. Enhanced Architecture

- **Multi-Platform Application**: Adapts to hardware capabilities across Pi3, Pi4, Pi5, and Linux
- **Shared MQTT Broker**: All devices and zones use intelligent connection multiplexing  
- **Enhanced Audio Manager**: Three-subsystem audio architecture with MPV-based playback
- **Hardware Optimization**: Platform-specific performance tuning and hardware acceleration
- **Modular Device System**: Extensible framework for screens, lights, relays, and custom devices
- **Real-time Coordination**: Subsystem coordination for seamless multi-zone experiences
- **Device Routing**: Commands are automatically routed to correct device handlers based on MQTT topic
- **Audio Integration**: Audio effects are tied to specific screen devices
- **External API Placeholders**: Framework includes placeholders for Hue, WiZ, Zigbee, and Z-Wave controllers

### 6. Status and Error Reporting

**Soft Device (Zone) Reporting**: Each soft device listens for commands on its configured MQTT command topic and publishes two types of messages to its status topic:

1. **State Updates**: Published whenever soft device state changes

   ```json
   {
     "timestamp": "2025-07-03T10:30:00Z",
     "device": "zone1-hdmi0",
     "type": "state",
     "status": "playing_video",
     "current_media": "video1.mp4",
     "queue_length": 2
   }
   ```

2. **Problem Reports**: Published when warnings or errors occur specific to that soft device

   ```json
   {
     "timestamp": "2025-07-03T10:30:00Z",
     "device": "zone1-hdmi0", 
     "type": "warning",
     "error_code": "MEDIA_NOT_FOUND",
     "message": "File video1.mp4 not found in media directory",
     "source_topic": "paradox/zone1/screen/commands"
   }
   ```

**Physical Device Heartbeat**: The physical device publishes comprehensive status to a heartbeat topic:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-03T10:30:00Z",
  "device_name": "pi4-controller-01", 
  "hostname": "paradox-pi4",
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
  "uptime": 86400000,
  "cpu_usage": 15.2,
  "gpu_usage": 8.5,
  "memory_usage": 45.8,
  "gpu_temp": 42.1,
  "cpu_temp": 38.7,
  "state": "running",
  "zones_active": 2,
  "zones_idle": 0
}
```

### 7. Framework Provisions

- **Effect Macros**: Framework structure for lighting effects (FADE, BLINK, etc.) to be implemented later
- **Process Managers**: Framework for managing external media player instances (up to 8 concurrent) to be implemented later
- **External Controllers**: Placeholder classes for Hue, WiZ, Zigbee, and Z-Wave integrations

### 8. Media Player Support

ParadoxFX uses MPV extensively for media playback:

- **MPV Integration**: MPV-based playback with JSON IPC for control. Images and video are managed by a zone-specific MPV process; background music and speech use separate MPV instances managed by the AudioManager.
- **IPC Control**: JSON-based socket communication for real-time control
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Platform-specific optimization (GPU decode, etc.)
- **Audio System Integration**: The implementation uses PulseAudio-compatible tooling (pactl, combined sinks). Pure PipeWire-only workflows are not guaranteed and may require additional mapping.
- **Multi-Instance**: Independent MPV processes are used per soft device/zone for media; additional MPV instances exist for background audio and speech.

### 9. Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Included with actual MQTT message testing against localhost broker
- **Integration Tests**: Test external media player wrappers with mock implementations
- **Configuration Tests**: Validate INI file parsing and device initialization
